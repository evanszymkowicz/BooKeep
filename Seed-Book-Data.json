He went to sleep with gum in his mouth and woke up with gum in his hair. When he got out of bed, he tripped over his skateboard and by mistake dropped his sweater in the sink while the water was running. He could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. It was a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. Nothing at all was right. Everything went wrong, right down to lima beans for supper and kissing on TV. What do you do on a day like that? Well, you may think about going to Australia. You may also be glad to find that some days are like that for other people too.","genre":"ADVENTURE","checkoutDate":null},
{"id":"5b91ec0203ee510014adabbc","author":"Maurie Sendak","readingLevel":"Grade 4","title":"WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE","description":" The wild things--with their mismatched parts and giant eyes--manage somehow to be scary-looking without ever really being scary; at times they're downright hilarious. Sendak's defiantly run-on sentences--one of his trademarks--lend the perfect touch of stream of consciousness to the tale, which floats between the land of dreams and a child's imagination. This Sendak classic is more fun than you've ever had in a wolf suit, and it manages to reaffirm the notion that there's no place like home. ","genre":"PICTURE BOOK","checkoutDate":null},
{"id":"5b91ec0b03ee510014adabbd","author":"Ezra Jack Keats","readingLevel":"Kindergarten","title":"THE SNOWY DAY","description":"The Snowy Day, a 1963 Caldecott Medal winner, is the simple tale of a boy waking up to discover that snow has fallen during the night. Keats's illustrations, using cut-outs, watercolors, and collage, are strikingly beautiful in their understated color and composition. The tranquil story mirrors the calm presence of the paintings, and both exude the silence of a freshly snow-covered landscape. The little boy celebrates the snow-draped city with a day of humble adventures--experimenting with footprints, knocking snow from a tree, creating snow angels, and trying to save a snowball for the next day. Awakening to a winter wonderland is an ageless, ever-magical experience, and one made nearly visceral by Keats's gentle tribute.","genre":"PICTURE BOOK","checkoutDate":null},

{"id":"5b91ec2803ee510014adabc0","author":"Jane Yolen","readingLevel":"Kindergarten","title":"OWL MOON","description":"A girl and her father go owling on a moonlit winter night near the farm where they live. Bundled tight in wool clothes, they trudge through snow whiter than the milk in a cereal bowl; here and there, hidden in ink-blue shadows, a fox, raccoon, fieldmouse and deer watch them pass. An air of expectancy builds as Pa imitates the Great Horned Owl's call once without answer, then again. Schoenherr's watercolor washes depict a New England few readers see: the bold stare of a nocturnal owl, a bird's-eye view of a farmhouse. In harmony with the art, the melodious text brings to life an unusual countryside adventure","genre":"PICTURE BOOK","checkoutDate":null},
{"id":"5b91ec3103ee510014adabc1","author":"Shel Silverstein","readingLevel":"Grade 4","title":"THE GIVING TREE","description":"To say that this particular apple tree is a 'giving tree' is an understatement. In Shel Silverstein's popular tale of few words and simple line drawings, a tree starts out as a leafy playground, shade provider, and apple bearer for a rambunctious little boy. Making the boy happy makes the tree happy. While the message of this book is unclear (Take and take and take? Give and give and give? Complete self-sacrifice is good? Complete self-sacrifice is infinitely sad?), Silverstein has perhaps deliberately left the book open to interpretation.","genre":"PICTURE BOOK","checkoutDate":null},
